## WHAT?

### User stories:

> **As a disorganised person I want:**

> * to enter tasks I need to do into a web page so that I don't forget them
> * to view the tasks I have added in a list so that I can plan my day
> * to mark tasks as complete so that I can focus on the tasks I have left
> * the to-dos to be large enough so that I don't hit the wrong one with my thumb

> #### _Potential stretch goals_

> **As a disorganised person I want:**

> * to edit my to-dos so that I can amend them if the task changes
> * to click on any part of a to-do to mark it as complete so that it's easier for me to check to-dos off
> * a visual indication of which to-do I'm about to interact with so that it's clear what I'm editing

## WHY?
_To be written_

## HOW?
> How did you split up the work?

We started by splitting the first two functions (addToDo & deleteToDo) between the two groups, doing ping pong style programming in each pair. One person would write a test, the other would pass the test.

> How did you choose to pair?

We started with the pairs that we never got to on the previous project, changing groups whenever we finished a function or feature.

## STRUGGLES

Learning to follow TDD was challenging. MarkToDo function was written before we remembered TDD, but the others were done right!
