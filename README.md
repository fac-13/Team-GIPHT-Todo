## WHAT?

This project was to create a to do list app to add things to do. You should also be able to mark things as done and also delete from the list.

## WHY?
### User stories:

> **As a disorganised person I want:**

> * to enter tasks I need to do into a web page so that I don't forget them
> * to view the tasks I have added in a list so that I can plan my day
> * to mark tasks as complete so that I can focus on the tasks I have left
> * the to-dos to be large enough so that I don't hit the wrong one with my thumb

> #### _Potential stretch goals_

> **As a disorganised person I want:**

> * to edit my to-dos so that I can amend them if the task changes
> * to click on any part of a to-do to mark it as complete so that it's easier for me to check to-dos off
> * a visual indication of which to-do I'm about to interact with so that it's clear what I'm editing


_To be written_

## HOW?
> Priorities

We decided as a team to prioritise files in order of what we felt was necessary before moving to the next. Logic-DOM-Index-CSS.

> How did you split up the work?

We started by splitting the first two functions (addToDo & deleteToDo) between two pairs, doing ping pong style programming in each pair. One person would write a failing test, the other would pass the test.

> How did you choose to pair?

We started with the pairs that we never got to on the previous project, changing groups whenever we finished a function or feature.

## STRUGGLES

> Implementing TDD was difficult as it was newly introduced to everyone in our team this week. Over time we got comfortable with testing and understand the importance and benefits of using TDD.

> Learning to follow TDD was challenging. MarkToDo function was written before we remembered TDD, but the others were done right!

> Some of our biggest problems came when starting on the CSS. Team members had different techniques and approaches to styling and sizing, and so when merging files together there were many inconsistencies with units used i.e heights were set in rem in some places whilst other areas used vh.
